# miniDB (C++)

- This project implements a lightweight relational database engine in C++ using B-Trees for efficient data storage and retrieval. It supports essential CRUD operations (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) and integrates a custom SQL-like interface. Key functionalities include:

- Implemented a lexer and parser to process and validate SQL-like commands, converting them into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Extended B-Tree functionality to store rows with multiple columns and enforce primary key constraints.
Designed a modular backend to handle row-level updates and deletions efficiently.
Learned:

- Backend development and system design principles for relational database systems.
Advanced data structure implementation, particularly B-Trees.
Tokenization, parsing, and AST construction for SQL-like syntax.
# What's next?

Implement multi-threading to improve query performance.
Add indexing for faster search and retrieval of rows.
Build a frontend interface for interactive database operations.
